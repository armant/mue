Crowd a Movie
=============

The app uses Facebook API to let the user log in and select her Facebook friends that she is going to watch a movie with. After that, it accesses the user's and her friends' "liked" movies. Then it compiles the list of all movies and uses Rotten Tomatoes API to generate five suggestions for each of the movies. Finally, it scans all the movie suggestions and detects and displays the most popular ones.
